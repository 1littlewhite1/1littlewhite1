**Machine Learning-Based Prediction of AVOCs**


This Project is based on Python 3.12 and R4.1.1. The algal_density_prediction directory contains the implementation and predictive performance evaluation of GBDT, RF, KNN, SVM, and XGBoost models. It also includes feature importance analysis, SHAP analysis, EconML analysis (Python 3.8), PDP analysis and natural lake algal bloom risk assessment. The determination of biomarker thresholds was achieved using shap_gam. The original dataset comprises AVOCs and algal density data for Microcystis aeruginosa and Chlorella vulgaris.
